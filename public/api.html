    The api for the OPS school data has been kept simple for future extensibility. All calls result in a
    returned json string. The available calls are as follows:

    <h3>District Calls</h3>

    <h4>/districts</h4>

    Calls to /district will return a sorted list of all the districts with data on each district, including the
    a sorted list of all schools within that district. An example follows:

    <pre>
    [{
    "Id": 280709,
    "Name": "All Saints Catholic School",
    "CountyId": 28,
    "Schools": [{
    "Id": 280709001,
    "Name": "All Saints Catholic School",
    "CountyId": 28,
    "DistrictId": 280709,
    "Lat": 0,
    "Lon": 0
    }]
    </pre>

    <h4>/district/:id</h4>

    Furthermore, you can also specify a particular district id to get only that district. This call will return
    detailed information based on year for that specified district. For example, a call to /district/280749 will
    result in:

    <pre>
    {
    "District": {
    "Id": 280749,
    "Name": "Skutt Catholic High School",
    "CountyId": 28,
    "Schools": null,
    "Lat": 0,
    "Lon": 0
    },
    "EnrollmentsByYear": [{
    "Year": "20022003",
    "Teachers": 0,
    "Students": 645,
    "GradeEnrollment": [{
    "Grade": "09",
    "EnrollmentSize": 163
    }, {
    "Grade": "10",
    "EnrollmentSize": 196
    }, {
    "Grade": "11",
    "EnrollmentSize": 142
    }, {
    "Grade": "12",
    "EnrollmentSize": 144
    }]
    },
    </pre>

    And so forth for all the available years.
    
    <h3>School Calls</h3>
    
    <h4>/schools</h4>

    Calls to /schools will return a sorted list of all the schools with data on each school. Here's an example:

    <pre>
      "Id": 770001021,
      "Name": "Bellevue Elementary School",
      "CountyId": 77,
      "DistrictId": 770001,
      "Lat": 41.1267,
      "Lon": -95.9912
      },
    </pre>

    <h4>/school/:id</h4>

    As with districts, you can specify a school id to get just that school. This data also includes enrollment
    by year with class size. Subsequently, querying the on the above school id will give you: 

    <pre>
    {
    "School": {
    "Id": 770001021,
    "Name": "Bellevue Elementary School",
    "CountyId": 77,
    "DistrictId": 770001,
    "Lat": 41.12670135498047,
    "Lon": -95.99120330810547
    },
    "EnrollmentByYear": [{
    "Year": "20092010",
    "Teachers": 0,
    "Students": 432,
    "GradeEnrollment": [{
    "Grade": "01",
    "EnrollmentSize": 56
    }, {
    "Grade": "02",
    "EnrollmentSize": 55
    }, {
    "Grade": "03",
    "EnrollmentSize": 56
    }, {
    "Grade": "04",
    "EnrollmentSize": 56
    }, {
    "Grade": "05",
    "EnrollmentSize":
    73
    }, {
    "Grade":
    "06",
    "EnrollmentSize":
    55
    },
    {
    "Grade":
    "K",
    "EnrollmentSize":
    61
    },
    {
    "Grade":
    "PK",
    "EnrollmentSize":
    20
    }]
    }, 
    </pre>
